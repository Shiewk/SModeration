# SModeration
### An easy-to-use minecraft plugin for moderating your server.

SModeration can be used to mute, ban, and kick players that break the rules while providing a nice interface to your moderators.
It keeps track of all punishments to ensure that you get a complete overview of every rule violation on your server.
You can also modify player inventories and ender chests.

If you have any feature requests, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Shiewk/SModeration/issues).
